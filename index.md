Welcome to the MMU Computing Society, this year (2018/19) your official Society Committee is [Sean O'Mahoney](https://twitter.com/Sean12697){:target='_blank'} as Chairman and [Iqrah Nadeem](https://twitter.com/i_iqrah){:target='_blank'} as Treasurer (also Chair of the [HelloHackers Society](https://twitter.com/helloHackersSoc){:target='_blank'}).

We wish to make the Society more collaborative with all that we do, desiring knowledgeable members, or those that have particular digital skills, to participate in the organization of future workshops we run.

Our aims are to:

*   Increase employability in the Digital Field for our members
*   Run & Promote Workshops on the teaching of Digital Skills
*   Integrate & Promote Computing/Learning in the CMDT Faculty
*   Work with external Companies/Speakers/Societies to run events
*   Create a social space for our members to share insights/news

You will find various useful links below for programmers of any skill level (descriptions and more will be added in time), for those who want to learn how to code or other digital skills, as well as those maybe in their final year of Computer Science and want to top off their CV.

To join the Computing Society go to [The Union](https://www.theunionmmu.org/groups/computing-society-7c13){:target='_blank'} website and sign in (with your University credentials), or visit [the Union](https://goo.gl/maps/neg9kydCrJm){:target='_blank'} and go to the first floor.

To keep up-to-date join our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MMUComputingSociety){:target='_blank'} and follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MMUCompSoc).

## Internal Events

COMING SOON

## External Events / Networking

Many external tech groups that usually meet up regularly (often Monthly) can be found on [Meetup](http://meetup.com/){:target='_blank'}, although you can also use [this](http://mcrmeetup.tech/){:target='_blank'} other website I (Sean) have created which curates specifically the Tech Meetup Groups in Manchester and lets you view all their events.

Below is another calendar, the [technw](http://technw.uk/calendar){:target='_blank'} calendar, which has been created by [Gemma Cameron](https://twitter.com/ruby_gem){:target='_blank'} from the Co-op for event organisers to add their events, although often you will have to RSVP through Meetup or Eventbrite, so do check the details of an event you are interested in attending.

## Learning Code

Here a few sites you can use to learn how to code, even if it is your first time programming:

*   [Lynda (Free for Students)](https://www.lynda.com/){:target='_blank'}
*   [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/){:target='_blank'}

*   [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/play){:target='_blank'}
*   [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/uk){:target='_blank'}

## Practicing Code

Ideal for those who have knowledge of programming, but are rusty or want to practice what they have learned, even good for those returning back to a Computing course after a break (a large chunk of these coming from [CodeUp Manchester](https://codeupmanchester.github.io/activities.html){:target='_blank'}):

*   [Reddit: Daily Programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/){:target='_blank'}
*   [#100DaysOfCode](https://100daysofcode.com/){:target='_blank'}
*   [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/){:target='_blank'}

*   [Edabit](https://edabit.com/){:target='_blank'}

## Learning Groups

Here are groups that meetup usually monthly around Manchester, in which people attend to learn how to code or teach how to, you do need to bring your own laptop, although do check out the details on their groups:

*   [Free Code Camp Manchester (UK)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.manchester/){:target='_blank'}
*   [CodeUp Manchester](https://www.meetup.com/CodeUpManchester/){:target='_blank'}
*   [CodeUp Salford](https://www.meetup.com/CodeUp-Salford/){:target='_blank'}
*   [codebar Manchester](https://www.meetup.com/Codebar-Manchester/){:target='_blank'}

## Volunteering

These are various groups that need competent programmers (third year students recommended) of various backgrounds to volunteer their knowledge/skills:

*   [EndHomelessness (C#/.Net/Front-end)](https://www.meetup.com/EndHomelessness-digital-community/){:target='_blank'}
*   [CodeYourFuture (HTML, CSS, JS, React and/or Node)](https://www.meetup.com/CodeYourFuture-Manchester/){:target='_blank'}

## Discord

This form of communication is often favoured by gamers, so there are a few channels worth mention specifically for students in the CMDT faculty:

*   [MMU CMDT Unofficial](https://discord.gg/KX4KPet){:target='_blank'}

This Discord Server has been for us all to use in the CMDT faculty, the goals for it are to help form a community (all social/gaming/academic) and relay information about any important events internally or externally (with dedicated channels), helping improve employability and hopefully aid in other ways.

This is unofficial from the university so they cannot be held responsible nor can any staff member (so do reach out to them with any more pressing questions), also plagiarism is against university policy so be careful what you post and really, just try to have fun.

## Slacks

Slack, if you do not know, is a messaging service (similar to Discord) which most people in the industry use, due to this various communities have set up their own Slack channels to communicate, so here are most listed below:

*   [CodeUp Manchester](https://codeupmanchester.github.io/resources.html){:target='_blank'}
*   [Free Code Camp Manchester (UK)](https://fcc-mcr-invite.herokuapp.com/){:target='_blank'}
*   [North West Tech Community](http://mcrtech-slack.herokuapp.com/){:target='_blank'}
*   [Candles (UX)](https://slofile.com/slack/withcandles){:target='_blank'}
