Welcome to the MMU Computing Society, this year (2018/19) your official Society Committee is [Sean O'Mahoney](https://twitter.com/Sean12697){:target='_blank'} as Chairman and [Iqrah Nadeem](https://twitter.com/i_iqrah){:target='_blank'} as Treasurer (also Chair of the [HelloHackers Society](https://twitter.com/helloHackersSoc){:target='_blank'}).

We wish to make the Society more collaborative with all that we do, desiring knowledgeable members, or those that have particular digital skills, to participate in the organization of future workshops we run.

Our aims are to:

*   Increase employability in the Digital Field for our members
*   Run & Promote Workshops on the teaching of Digital Skills
*   Integrate & Promote Computing/Learning in the CMDT Faculty
*   Work with external Companies/Speakers/Societies to run events
*   Create a social space for our members to share insights/news

You will find various useful links below for programmers of any skill level (descriptions and more will be added in time), for those who want to learn how to code or other digital skills, as well as those maybe in their final year of Computer Science and want to top off their CV.

To join the Computing Society go to [The Union](https://www.theunionmmu.org/groups/computing-society-7c13){:target='_blank'} website and sign in (with your University credentials), or visit [the Union](https://goo.gl/maps/neg9kydCrJm){:target='_blank'} and go to the first floor.

To keep up-to-date join our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MMUComputingSociety){:target='_blank'} and follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MMUCompSoc).

## Essential Advice

To all/any of our members studying a Computing related course, or wish to go into industry from another course, here are a few key pieces of advice which you should follow:

*   Attend [Hackathons / Game Jams]({{site.url}}{{page.url}}#hackathons--game-jams)
*   Go to [networking events]({{site.url}}{{page.url}}#external-events--networking), become part of the local tech' community
*   Start using [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/){:target='_blank'} and add people you meet from the above events
*   Take part and earn University lead/ran [Awards]({{site.url}}{{page.url}}#awards--activities)
*   [Volunteering]({{site.url}}{{page.url}}#volunteering) looks good on your CV and can improve your skills
*   Mentoring at [Learning Groups]({{site.url}}{{page.url}}#learning-groups) (similar to the above)
*   Learn Git/GitHub and maybe contribute to this project
*   MMU has a useful [My Career Hub](mycareerhub.mmu.ac.uk){:target='_blank'} section

Apart from these generic bullet points, don't just focus on the work to get you a high class honours degree. You should work on projects outside of University, no matter if that's following up on pieces of work from assignments, or working on new ones.

## Internal Events

These are events usually ran on MMU ground and usually hosted/ran by the University or Staff:

<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/2/embed?showTitle=0&amp;showNav=0&amp;showDate=0&amp;showPrint=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;showTz=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=200&amp;wkst=2&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=hf9guet2dna8uu0klhmemejops%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%23B1365F&amp;ctz=Europe%2FLondon" style="border-width:0" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

## Conferences

There are various confrences across the UK that are either free or at a low cost to students, often you find two types, normal confrences with set tracks, then un-confrences which often include set tracks with guest speakers, but also include tracks for people to run their own talks (which is often voted on, on the day).

## Hackathons / Game Jams

[Major League Hacking (MLH)](https://mlh.io/){:target='_blank'} is the official student hackathon league and can be a useful place to visit, but here are the hackathons and game jams we are aware of in the UK (mainly in the North West):

*   [1st Local Transport Ideathon Manchester 2019](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1st-local-transport-ideathon-manchester-2019-tickets-53567988295){:target='_blank'} (Free): 22-24th February
*   [Global Legal Hackathon: Manchester](https://glh.hivebrite.com/events/13639){:target='_blank'} (Free): 22-24th February
*   [Hack on the Beach](https://careers.onthebeach.co.uk/hackathon){:target='_blank'} (Free): 23rd March
*   [HackMed 2019](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hackmed-2019-tickets-55562319393?aff=ebdssbdestsearch){:target='_blank'} (Free): 30-21st March

## External Events / Networking

Many external tech groups that usually meet up regularly (often Monthly) can be found on [Meetup](http://meetup.com/){:target='_blank'}, although you can also use [this](http://mcrmeetup.tech/){:target='_blank'} other website I (Sean) have created which curates specifically the Tech Meetup Groups in Manchester and lets you view all their events.

Below is another calendar, the [technw](http://technw.uk/calendar){:target='_blank'} calendar, which has been created by [Gemma Cameron](https://twitter.com/ruby_gem){:target='_blank'} from the Co-op for event organisers to add their events, although often you will have to RSVP through Meetup or Eventbrite, so do check the details of an event you are interested in attending.

Also, if you would like to attend networking events with fellow students, use [this](http://mcrmeetup.space/){:target='_blank'} tool to help find and message them via Meetup (or Twitter/Facebook if they're linked on their profile), if you would like to be added to that list, please read the text in the information drop-down section on the website.

*   [Reddit: Daily Programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/){:target='_blank'}

*   [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/){:target='_blank'}

## IDE's (Editors)

If you were to write code you want somewhere to write it, maybe in Notepad for a simple website, but here are some very useful IDE's (Integrated Development Environment) which provide many useful features:

*  [Repl.it](https://repl.it/){:target='_blank'} (Online IDE)
*  [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/){:target='_blank'} (Interactive Computing)

*  [Jet Brains (Free for Students)](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/){:target='_blank'} (Various)

## Learning Groups

Here are groups that meetup usually monthly around Manchester, in which people attend to learn how to code or teach how to, you do need to bring your own laptop, although do check out the details on their groups:

*   [Free Code Camp Manchester (UK)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.manchester/){:target='_blank'}
*   [CodeUp Manchester](https://www.meetup.com/CodeUpManchester/){:target='_blank'}
*   [CodeUp Salford](https://www.meetup.com/CodeUp-Salford/){:target='_blank'}
*   [codebar Manchester](https://www.meetup.com/Codebar-Manchester/){:target='_blank'}

## Volunteering

The Union does have a dedicated [volunteering service](https://www.theunionmmu.org/volunteering){:target='_blank'}, but here are various groups that need competent programmers (third year students recommended) of various backgrounds to volunteer their knowledge/skills:

*   [EndHomelessness (C#/.Net/Front-end)](https://www.meetup.com/EndHomelessness-digital-community/){:target='_blank'}
*   [CodeYourFuture (HTML, CSS, JS, React and/or Node)](https://www.meetup.com/CodeYourFuture-Manchester/){:target='_blank'}

## Discord

This form of communication is often favoured by gamers, so there are a few channels worth mention specifically for students in the CMDT faculty:

*   [MMU CMDT Unofficial](https://discord.gg/KX4KPet){:target='_blank'}

This Discord Server has been for us all to use in the CMDT faculty, the goals for it are to help form a community (all social/gaming/academic) and relay information about any important events internally or externally (with dedicated channels), helping improve employability and hopefully aid in other ways.

This is unofficial from the university so they cannot be held responsible nor can any staff member (so do reach out to them with any more pressing questions), also plagiarism is against university policy so be careful what you post and really, just try to have fun.

## Slacks

Slack, if you do not know, is a messaging service (similar to Discord) which most people in the industry use, due to this various communities have set up their own Slack channels to communicate, so here are most listed below:

*   [CodeUp Manchester](https://codeupmanchester.github.io/resources.html){:target='_blank'}
*   [Free Code Camp Manchester (UK)](https://fcc-mcr-invite.herokuapp.com/){:target='_blank'}
*   [North West Tech Community](http://mcrtech-slack.herokuapp.com/){:target='_blank'}
*   [Candles (UX)](https://slofile.com/slack/withcandles){:target='_blank'}
