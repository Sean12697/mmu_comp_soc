## External Events: 

Below is another calendar, the [technw](http://technw.uk/calendar){:target='_blank'} calendar, which has been created by [Gemma Cameron](https://twitter.com/ruby_gem){:target='_blank'} from the Co-op for event organisers to add their events. Although, often you will have to RSVP through Meetup or Eventbrite, so do check the details of an event you are interested in attending.

Also, if you would like to attend networking events with fellow students, use [this](http://mcrmeetup.space/){:target='_blank'} tool to help find and message them via Meetup (or Twitter/Facebook if they're linked on their profile), if you would like to be added to that list, please read the text in the information drop-down section on the website.
