The MMU Computing Society is a student-powered group that aims to be a networking and resource hub for Computer Science and other Computing, Mathematics and Digital Technology students. With membership to our society, you'll join an invaluable and ever-growing network of past, and present MMU students who can assist you as you begin your journey into a career in Technology. We run frequent socials, workshops, talks from industry experts and other events to help grow our knowledge of industry-relevant skills. 
We now offer, on this website, an increasing amount of curated resources from our past workshops, as well as informative guides about your university journey, links to external events and news.
